what's the problem of smartPtr?

opreator= assignment / copy ctor --> provide instance other with same pointer
and if we do delete on pointer as the else pointer also delete
and this problem maybe the second pointer is used after the delete
this provides delete((delete(add))) dobule detele this problem --> returens undefined 

// =============================//
what is smartPtr?

smartPtr --> is delete the pointer if there is i.g. exception 
 myClass obj = new Obj();
 obj.foo(); throw exception 
delete(obj)

// os smartPtr is responsible for destroy the pointer
UniquePtr<int> p = UniquePtr(new int ())
if there is except so is responsible for destroy the pointer
